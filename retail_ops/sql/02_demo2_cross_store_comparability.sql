-- Demo 2: same-period cross-store diagnostic
-- Source tables expected:
--   demo2_store_period_metrics
--   demo2_top_skus_by_transaction_amount
--
-- This SQL does not decide pairwise store comparability and does not rank stores as better or worse.
-- It derives same-period diagnostic fields and flags limits for cautious interpretation.
-- The March 2026 date check is part of the Demo 2 fixture contract, not a reusable production SQL parameterization.

-- Output ordering by region_type and store_type is for readability only.
-- It is not a peer-grouping rule and does not make region_type a hard comparability gate.
