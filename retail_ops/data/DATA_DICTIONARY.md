# Meituan Backend Metric Dictionary

This file documents the Meituan backend metric definitions used in the retail operations demo.

The purpose is to prevent Meituan backend numbers from being treated as generic business metrics without checking their original platform meaning, reporting window, denominator, and data grain.

## Naming Convention

The canonical English field names in this project are the implemented CSV / SQL field names used in the current retail demos.

Demo 1:
- `retail_ops/data/store_a_monthly_metrics.csv`
- `retail_ops/data/store_a_top_skus.csv`
- `retail_ops/sql/01_store_a_month_over_month_diagnostic.sql`
- `retail_ops/outputs/store_a_demo1_sql_output.csv`
- `retail_ops/outputs/generated_retail_memory_facts.json`

Demo 2:
- `retail_ops/data/demo2_store_period_metrics.csv`
- `retail_ops/data/demo2_top_search_terms.csv`
- `retail_ops/data/demo2_top_skus_by_sales_volume.csv`
- `retail_ops/data/demo2_top_skus_by_transaction_amount.csv`
- `retail_ops/sql/02_demo2_cross_store_comparability.sql`
- `retail_ops/outputs/demo2_cross_store_comparability_output.csv`
- `retail_ops/outputs/generated_demo2_retail_memory_facts.json`

Chinese Meituan backend labels are mapped to these implemented English field names.

### Path / File-Name Terms vs Implemented Meaning

Some current paths contain `cross_store_comparability` for reference stability. In the current implemented scope, `demo2_cross_store_*` paths mean Demo 2 same-period cross-store diagnostic artifacts. In those paths, `comparability` refers to diagnostic readiness and interpretation guardrails, not a pairwise store-matching gate. The planned pairwise gate is documented in `retail_ops/COMPARABILITY_GATE_V0.md` and is not implemented in current Demo 2 outputs. Any future path or field rename must go through the same field/path review table before implementation.

Each Meituan backend metric is mapped to one canonical English field name in this project.

If a field is ever renamed, the change must be documented with a migration note and updated consistently across CSV, SQL, SQL outputs, memory facts, lineage, README, admissions documents, and evaluation cases.

Examples:

- 入店人数 = `entry_users`
- 入店次数 = `entry_times`
- 搜索入店人数 = `search_entry_users`
- 支付人数 = `payment_users`
- 支付金额 = `payment_amount`
- 活动营业总额 = `activity_original_transaction_amount`
- 预计收入 / 预计订单收入 proxy = `estimated_income_proxy`

## Store Entity ID Convention / 门店实体 ID 规则

`store_id` is the canonical store identifier used in source CSV files, SQL diagnostics, and metric outputs.

`entity_id` is the retrieval-layer identifier used in generated retail memory facts.

For store-level retail facts, `entity_id` MUST be generated from `store_id` using the following rule:

`entity_id = "store_" + store_id`

Example:

- `store_id = A`
- `entity_id = store_A`

`store_id` must not be replaced by `entity_id` in metric CSV files or SQL outputs.

`entity_id` must not be used as a raw metric-table key unless a future data contract explicitly documents that change.

---

## Region / Market Context Field Status / 区域与经营环境字段状态

### `region_type`

Current status: `region_type` is retained as the implemented metadata field used by the current retail data contract.

In the current demo, `region_type` should be read only as a weak region or market-context field from available store evidence. It is not a store-stage label, not a mature market-area classification, and not a sufficient condition for deciding whether two stores are comparable.

This limitation is intentional. The current sample is too small to support a reliable data-driven regional classification. Classifying stores by subjective experience, intuition, address impression, or habitual labels would create false confidence. Different stores with similar visible region labels may still face different purchasing power, delivery radius, local competition, rent structure, promotion pressure, customer behavior, stockout risk, and fulfillment constraints.

Therefore, `region_type` alone must not be used as a hard comparability gate. In the current project, it can only appear as context that should be combined with period alignment, store type, order volume, visibility and ranking signals, entry and order conversion, activity profile, refund and invalid-order pressure, SKU evidence, data completeness, and future external market evidence.

Future market-area classification should be created only when the project has enough store coverage and supporting evidence. If a future demo introduces such a classification, it must be added as new documented fields rather than silently changing the meaning of `region_type`.

Possible future fields:

- `market_area_type`: a documented data-supported market-area classification.
- `market_area_type_source`: the evidence or rule used for the classification.
- `market_area_type_confidence`: whether the classification is data-supported, manually reviewed, or uncertain.

Until those fields are defined, the system should treat market-area classification as an unresolved comparability issue rather than a hard label.

## Source Metrics vs SQL-Derived Diagnostics / 后台原始指标与 SQL 派生诊断边界

Most canonical fields in this dictionary are normalized representations of metrics observed directly from the Meituan merchant backend.

The current Demo 1 SQL does not claim to create or infer those backend metrics. Instead, SQL is used to derive a limited set of diagnostic fields from already-normalized canonical source metrics.

Current derived outputs are separated into two layers.

1. SQL output columns:
- share / ratio diagnostics, such as `search_entry_share_pct`, `refund_pressure_pct`, `invalid_order_pressure_pct`, and `top3_sku_transaction_amount_share_pct`;
- month-over-month diagnostics, such as `transaction_amount_mom_pct`, `entry_users_mom_pct`, and `refund_amount_mom_pct`;
- ranking-change and boolean supporting diagnostics, such as `store_average_rank_change`, `search_average_rank_change`, `transaction_recovered_with_conversion_aov_tradeoff`, and `refund_pressure_improved`.

2. Memory-facing artifacts:
- retrieval-facing slots such as `visibility_entry_profile`, `activity_lever_profile`, `transaction_conversion_profile`, `order_quality_pressure_profile`, `single_metric_attribution_guard`, and `top3_sku_product_mix_note`.

Memory-facing slots are generated from multiple source fields and SQL-derived columns. They are not raw Meituan backend fields and should not be treated as SQL output headers. The SQL layer must not silently rename, redefine, or reverse-engineer Meituan backend metrics. It also must not turn one threshold into a fixed store-stage label. For example, `order_conversion_rate_pct` follows the backend definition and must not be recomputed from `valid_orders / entry_users`.

Any new SQL-derived field must be explicitly documented before it is used in generated outputs or memory facts.


### Future Pairwise Comparability-Gate Fields

Pairwise comparability-gate fields are not currently implemented.

The current implemented retail scope stops at Demo 2. A future comparability gate should only be added after broader multi-store evidence is available.

Reliable store comparability should depend on transaction order volume, transaction amount, current activity involvement and intensity based on existing activity fields, explicit activity status or campaign-calendar evidence if available, store type, region and market context, competition environment, SKU structure, refund pressure, invalid-order pressure, and repeated reporting windows.

At the current sample size, `region_type` remains weak context only. It is not a hard market-area classification, store-stage label, or peer-store grouping rule.

Future market-context fields should only be added after they are documented before use and supported by broader multi-store evidence.

### Demo 1 SQL-Derived Diagnostic Details

The following fields are not Meituan backend metrics. They are SQL-derived diagnostics created from normalized source metrics for Store A Demo 1.

#### Month-over-month diagnostics

Fields ending in `_mom_pct` compare the current month with the previous available month for the same `store_id`, ordered by `period_start`.

Formula:

```text
current_metric_mom_pct = (current_metric - previous_metric) / previous_metric * 100
```

Examples:

- `transaction_amount_mom_pct`
- `transaction_orders_mom_pct`
- `estimated_income_proxy_mom_pct`
- `exposure_users_mom_pct`
- `search_exposure_users_mom_pct`
- `entry_users_mom_pct`
- `search_entry_users_mom_pct`
- `order_users_mom_pct`
- `payment_users_mom_pct`
- `average_order_value_mom_pct`
- `refund_amount_mom_pct`

Interpretation limit: MoM diagnostics describe directional change between adjacent observed months. They do not prove causality and should not be used alone to label a store as better or worse.

#### Ranking-change diagnostics

`store_average_rank_change` and `search_average_rank_change` compare the current month with the previous available month for the same `store_id`.

Formula:

```text
rank_change = current_rank - previous_rank
```

Because lower ranking numbers indicate better position, a negative value means the average position improved, while a positive value means the average position worsened.

Interpretation limit: ranking change should be read together with exposure, entry, conversion, activity, and order-quality signals. It should not be treated as a standalone explanation for transaction change.

#### Boolean supporting diagnostics

`transaction_recovered_with_conversion_aov_tradeoff` is a SQL-derived supporting observation. It is true only when the latest observed month for the same `store_id` has higher `transaction_amount` and higher `transaction_orders` than the previous month, while `order_conversion_rate_pct` and `average_order_value` both decline.

`refund_pressure_improved` is a SQL-derived supporting observation. It is true only when the latest observed month for the same `store_id` has lower `refund_pressure_pct` than the previous month.

Interpretation limit: these boolean fields are not canonical memory slots and must not be treated as store-stage labels. They only support broader memory slots such as `transaction_conversion_profile` and `order_quality_pressure_profile`.


## Demo 2 Same-Period Diagnostic Guardrail Fields

The following fields are SQL-derived diagnostic fields used in Demo 2. They are not Meituan backend metrics and must not be interpreted as store-stage labels, best-store rankings, or operating recommendations.

### `comparison_scope_flag`

Type: SQL-derived diagnostic text field.

Purpose:
`comparison_scope_flag` records whether a store-period row is inside the current Demo 2 comparison scope before any operating interpretation is made.

Current values:
- `same_period_diagnostic_ready`: the row has the required same-period fields for the current Demo 2 diagnostic.
- `not_comparable_period_mismatch`: the row does not match the Demo 2 reporting window.
- `insufficient_data`: one or more required diagnostic fields are missing.

Correct use:
This field is a data-readiness and comparison-scope guardrail. It helps the memory layer decide whether a same-period cross-store diagnostic can be discussed.

Design reason: In Demo 2, `same_period_diagnostic_ready` requires both aligned reporting windows and the required diagnostic evidence for the current comparison scope. Top-3 SKU transaction-amount evidence is included because Demo 2 uses lightweight product-mix evidence to qualify cross-store interpretation. If that evidence is missing, the row should be treated as `insufficient_data` rather than as comparable with zero SKU concentration.

Not supported:
This field must not be used as a store-stage label, performance ranking, causal explanation, or operating recommendation.

### `comparison_limit_notes`

Type: SQL-derived diagnostic text field.

Purpose:
`comparison_limit_notes` records caution notes generated from documented Demo 2 threshold checks. It explains why cross-store comparison should be constrained even when stores share the same reporting window.

Current threshold and evidence-completeness notes:
- `missing_transaction_amount`: `transaction_amount` is missing, so amount-based ratios such as `refund_pressure_pct` and `top3_sku_transaction_amount_share_pct` should not be interpreted as comparable evidence.
- `missing_valid_orders`: `valid_orders` is missing, so `invalid_order_pressure_pct` should not be interpreted as comparable evidence.
- `missing_top3_sku_amount_evidence`: top-SKU transaction-amount evidence is missing, so missing product-mix evidence must not be treated as zero concentration.
- `high_search_entry_dependence`: `search_entry_share_pct >= 85`
- `high_activity_involvement`: `activity_order_share_pct >= 80`
- `moderate_activity_involvement`: `activity_order_share_pct >= 65`
- `high_refund_pressure`: `refund_pressure_pct >= 15`
- `moderate_refund_pressure`: `refund_pressure_pct >= 10`
- `high_invalid_order_pressure`: `invalid_order_pressure_pct >= 12`
- `moderate_invalid_order_pressure`: `invalid_order_pressure_pct >= 8`
- `top3_sku_amount_concentration`: `top3_sku_transaction_amount_share_pct >= 25`
- `compare_with_region_store_type_activity_refund_limits`: default reminder that region, store type, activity, refund, order-quality, and product-mix evidence constrain direct comparison.

Correct use:
This field is used by the memory layer as an interpretation-boundary note. It preserves comparison limits when answering cross-store questions.

Not supported:
This field does not rank stores, assign store stages, prove causality, or decide whether a promotion, subsidy, price change, SKU change, or ranking action should be taken.

## Generated Retail Memory Fact Semantics / 生成零售记忆事实语义

Generated retail memory facts are not raw Meituan backend exports.

They are retrieval-facing summaries grounded in canonical source fields, SQL output columns, and documented limitations.

- `entity_id` is the retrieval-layer identifier derived from `store_id`.
- `period_label` identifies the target period or comparison window of the memory fact.
- `period_start` and `period_end` record the exact date range represented by the memory fact.
- `period_granularity` records the time grain of the memory fact. In the current demos, the value is `month`. It is retrieval / interpretation metadata, not a direct Meituan backend metric.
- `observed_values` may include baseline periods when the fact is comparative.
- `source_fields` lists the canonical fields or SQL-derived diagnostics supporting the fact.
- `source_path` records the primary generated output file supporting the memory fact.
- `supporting_source_paths` is an optional list of additional source files when a memory fact includes evidence that does not appear directly in `source_path`, such as top search-term or top-SKU source tables.
- `confidence` means evidence-trace confidence: whether the fact is directly supported by available source fields and SQL output.
- `confidence` does not mean causal confidence, profit confidence, or cross-store transferability.
- `limitations` must state unsupported interpretations, such as cross-store transfer, causal attribution, unaudited profit, incomplete SKU classification, or unknown promotion cycles.

Generated retail memory facts must not introduce new field names, new metric definitions, or new store-stage labels unless those names are first documented in this data dictionary, lineage file, and slot registry.


## Retail Memory Slot Contract / 零售记忆槽位合同

Retail memory slots are retrieval-facing summaries derived from canonical Meituan backend fields and SQL diagnostics.

They are not raw Meituan backend metrics, not store-stage labels, and not one-threshold flags.

The current Store A Demo 1 uses the following canonical retail memory slots:

| Slot | Meaning | Correct Use | Not Supported |
|---|---|---|---|
| `visibility_entry_profile` | Exposure, ranking, entry, and search-entry structure. | Understanding whether the store was being seen and entered during the reporting window. | Claiming visibility alone caused transaction growth. |
| `activity_lever_profile` | Activity orders, activity cost, subsidy, and activity-cost ratio. | Understanding how promotional tools were used in the store's operating context. | Treating activity as a standalone cause or traditional ROI result. |
| `transaction_conversion_profile` | Transaction scale, order conversion, payment, and average order value. | Reading transaction recovery or decline together with funnel quality. | Calling a period good or bad from one transaction metric alone. |
| `order_quality_pressure_profile` | Refund pressure, refund-order pressure, invalid-order pressure, and related order-quality signals. | Understanding whether order growth coexists with refund or cancellation pressure. | Proving customer satisfaction or fulfillment quality definitively improved. |
| `single_metric_attribution_guard` | Guardrail against explaining performance from one metric alone. | Preventing unsupported attribution from exposure, ranking, activity, conversion, refund, or SKU evidence alone. | Rejecting those metrics as irrelevant. |
| `top3_sku_product_mix_note` | Lightweight top-SKU evidence. | Describing limited leading-SKU evidence. | Full product-category sales-share analysis. |

A new retail memory slot should be added only when the same name is consistently used across:

1. generated retail memory facts;
2. SQL output or source-field lineage;
3. demo documentation;
4. README or project summary, if mentioned there;
5. retail evaluation cases, if retrieval-tested.

Supporting SQL observations such as transaction recovery, exposure movement, order-conversion decline, average-order-value decline, refund-pressure improvement, invalid-order-pressure improvement, activity-order share, and activity-cost ratio can support these slots, but they should not become independent canonical slots unless they are first documented here.


## 1. Traffic Exposure Metrics / 流量曝光指标

### `exposure_users` / 曝光人数

中文定义：所选周期内，对应位置看到商家的用户数。

English definition: Number of users who saw the merchant in the corresponding display position during the selected period.

Interpretation: This is a user-count metric, not an impression-count metric.

### `exposure_times` / 曝光次数

中文定义：所选周期内，对应位置商家被用户看到的次数。

English definition: Total number of times the merchant was seen by users in the corresponding display position during the selected period.

Interpretation: This is an impression-count metric, not a user-count metric.

### `store_average_rank` / 店铺曝光平均排名

中文定义：后台展示的店铺曝光平均排名。根据后台说明，平均排名通常指商家在商家列表和搜索列表内曝光位置的平均值。

English definition: Backend-reported average exposure rank for the store-level exposure view. According to the backend definition, average rank usually refers to the average exposure position across merchant-list and search-list contexts.

Interpretation: A lower number indicates a better average exposure position. This field should not be mixed with `search_average_rank` or `merchant_list_average_rank` unless the backend page scope is explicitly aligned.

### `search_exposure_users` / 搜索曝光人数

中文定义：所选周期内，通过搜索列表看到商家的用户数。

English definition: Number of users who saw the merchant through search-result exposure during the selected period.

Interpretation: This is a source-level exposure user metric. It should not be summed with other source-level exposure users as total exposure.

中文定义：所选周期内，通过其他来源看到商家的用户数。

English definition: Number of users who saw the merchant through other exposure sources during the selected period.

---

## 2. Store-Entry Metrics / 入店指标

### `entry_conversion_rate_pct` / 入店转化率

中文公式：入店转化率 = 入店人数 / 曝光人数

English formula: `entry_conversion_rate_pct = entry_users / exposure_users * 100`

Interpretation: This measures the share of exposed users who entered the merchant page.

### `entry_users` / 入店人数

中文定义：所选周期内，由店外进入到店内页面的用户数。

English definition: Number of users who entered the merchant page from outside the store page during the selected period.

Interpretation: This is a user-count metric.

### `entry_times` / 入店次数

中文定义：所选周期内，用户由店外进入到店内页面的次数。

English definition: Total number of visits from outside the store page into the merchant page during the selected period.

Interpretation: This is a visit/action-count metric, not a user-count metric.

### `entry_visit_duration_seconds` / 入店访问时长（s）

中文定义：所选周期内，用户从开始进入该商家相关页面到离开该商家相关页面所用的平均时间。

English definition: Average time in seconds from entering merchant-related pages to leaving merchant-related pages during the selected period.

### `search_entry_users` / 搜索入店人数

中文定义：所选周期内，通过搜索来源进入商家页面的用户数。

English definition: Number of users who entered the merchant page through search traffic during the selected period.

Interpretation: This is a source-level entry user metric. It is used as a directional search-entry signal, not as perfect user-level attribution.

### `merchant_list_entry_users` / 商家列表入店人数

中文定义：所选周期内，通过商家列表页进入商家页面的用户数。

English definition: Number of users who entered the merchant page through merchant-list traffic during the selected period.

### `activity_zone_entry_users` / 活动专区入店人数

中文定义：所选周期内，通过活动专区进入商家页面的用户数。

English definition: Number of users who entered the merchant page through activity-zone traffic during the selected period.

---

## 3. Order-Submission Funnel Metrics / 下单漏斗指标

### `order_conversion_rate_pct` / 下单转化率

中文公式：下单转化率 = 下单人数 / 入店人数

English formula: `order_conversion_rate_pct = order_users / entry_users * 100`

中文解释：本 demo 将 `order_conversion_rate_pct` 作为美团后台展示的下单转化率，不用有效订单数反推。

English interpretation: In this demo, `order_conversion_rate_pct` is treated as the backend-reported order conversion rate. It is not recomputed from valid orders.

It should not be recomputed as `valid_orders / entry_users`.

Reason:

- `order_users` / 下单人数 is a user-count funnel metric;
- `valid_orders` / 有效订单数 is an order-status metric;
- `entry_users` / 入店人数 is a user-count traffic metric.

### `order_users` / 下单人数

中文定义：所选周期内，最终提交订单的用户数。

English definition: Number of users who finally submitted orders during the selected period.

Interpretation: This is a user-count metric.

### `order_times` / 下单次数

中文定义：所选周期内，用户在商家最终提交订单的总次数。

English definition: Total number of final order-submission actions at the merchant during the selected period.

Interpretation: This is an order-submission/action-count metric.

### `order_amount` / 下单金额

中文定义：所选周期内，用户提交的订单的商品实付总金额。

English definition: Total actual paid commodity amount of submitted orders during the selected period.

---

## 4. Payment Funnel Metrics / 支付漏斗指标

### `payment_users` / 支付人数

中文定义：所选周期内，提交订单并成功支付的用户数。

English definition: Number of users who submitted orders and successfully paid during the selected period.

Interpretation: This is a user-count metric.

### `payment_amount` / 支付金额

中文定义：所选周期内，用户已支付订单的商品实付总金额。

English definition: Total actual paid commodity amount of paid orders during the selected period.

### `payment_conversion_rate_pct` / 支付转化率

中文公式：支付转化率 = 支付人数 / 下单人数

English formula: `payment_conversion_rate_pct = payment_users / order_users * 100`

Interpretation: This measures the share of order-submitting users who successfully paid.

---

## 5. Transaction Metrics / 成交指标

### `transaction_amount` / 成交金额

中文定义：所选时间周期内，该账号所选择条件下门店的当天支付且当天未取消的订单用户实际支付金额。

English definition: Actual amount paid by users for orders that were paid on the same day and not cancelled on the same day under the selected account, store, and time filters.

Interpretation: This is a same-day paid and same-day not-cancelled store-level transaction amount.

Important grain rule: `transaction_amount` is a store-period-level field in `store_a_monthly_metrics.csv` and SQL outputs. SKU-level transaction amount must use `sku_transaction_amount`.

### `transaction_orders` / 成交订单量

中文定义：所选时间周期内，该账号所选择条件下门店的当天支付且当天未取消的订单量。

English definition: Number of orders that were paid on the same day and not cancelled on the same day under the selected account, store, and time filters.

Interpretation: This is a same-day paid and same-day not-cancelled transaction-order count.

### `average_order_value` / 单均价

中文公式：单均价 = 成交金额 / 成交订单量

English formula: `average_order_value = transaction_amount / transaction_orders`

中文解释：在本 demo 中，`average_order_value` 按成交指标页面口径处理，即成交金额除以成交订单量。

English interpretation: In this demo, `average_order_value` follows the transaction-metric page definition: transaction amount divided by transaction orders.

Consistency note: If another backend page defines 单均价 as valid-order average price, that value should be treated as a separate backend-reported metric and should not be mixed with `average_order_value`.

Suggested future field if needed: `valid_order_average_value`.

### `business_district_rank` / 商圈排名

中文定义：该商家该指标在所在商圈内主营品类相同的商家中排名及排名变化情况。例如综合药店商家仅看在综合药店商家的排名区间。当门店无蜂窝信息或者无动销时，无商圈排名信息。

English definition: Ranking and ranking change of the merchant among merchants with the same main category in the same trade area. If the store has no honeycomb/location-cell information or no sales activity, no business-district ranking is available.

Current status: This field is defined for future use. It is not currently required in Demo 1 source CSV.

### `gross_revenue` / 营业额

中文定义：营业额为商家的真实流水总额，包含商品原价、餐盒费。针对自配送、众包配送订单，会同时包含顾客实付配送费；针对其他配送类型订单，营业额将不再包含用户支付的配送费。

English definition: Merchant gross transaction flow, including original item price and packaging fee. For self-delivery and crowdsourced delivery orders, it also includes customer-paid delivery fees; for other delivery types, it excludes customer-paid delivery fees.

Current status: This field is defined for future use. It is not currently required in Demo 1 source CSV.

Important distinction:

- `gross_revenue` = 营业额
- `transaction_amount` = 成交金额
- `estimated_income_proxy` = 预计收入 / 预计订单收入 proxy

These fields must not be treated as interchangeable.

### `estimated_income_proxy` / 预计收入 proxy / 预计订单收入 proxy

中文定义：平台展示的预计收入或预计订单收入类指标。预计订单收入通常指营业额扣除商家支出（包括商家补贴、平台服务费等）后的净收入，仅做数据展示，不做结算使用。

English definition: Platform-displayed estimated income after deducting merchant-side expenses such as merchant subsidies and platform service fees. It is for display only and should not be treated as settlement data.

Interpretation: This metric is treated as a proxy only. It is not treated as audited profit because the platform does not provide a full calculation breakdown in the current demo data.

---

## 6. Activity / Promotion Metrics / 活动与促销指标

### `activity_original_transaction_amount` / 活动营业总额

中文定义：享受了活动的订单原价交易额。

English definition: Original transaction amount of orders that received promotional benefits.

### `activity_orders` / 活动订单数

中文定义：营销活动带来的订单数。

English definition: Number of orders brought by marketing activities.

### `activity_cost` / 活动成本

中文公式：活动成本 = 商家补贴金额 + 平台补贴金额

English formula: `activity_cost = merchant_subsidy_amount + platform_subsidy_amount`

### `merchant_subsidy_amount` / 商家补贴金额

中文定义：在营销活动中，由商家承担的那部分活动补贴费用。

English definition: The portion of promotional subsidy borne by the merchant.

### `platform_subsidy_amount` / 平台补贴金额

中文定义：在营销活动中，由平台承担的那部分活动补贴费用。

English definition: The portion of promotional subsidy borne by the platform.

### `activity_cost_ratio_pct` / 投入产出比

中文公式：投入产出比 = 活动成本 / 活动营业总额

English formula used in this project: `activity_cost_ratio_pct = activity_cost / activity_original_transaction_amount * 100`

中文解释：该公式是成本除以活动带动营业额，因此数值越小，单位活动营业额对应的成本越低，活动效率越好。

English interpretation: This formula is cost divided by activity-driven revenue. Therefore, a smaller value indicates lower cost per unit of activity-driven revenue and better promotional efficiency.

Important naming rule:

- In this project, this metric is called `activity_cost_ratio_pct`.
- It should not be called traditional ROI, because traditional ROI is often interpreted as return divided by cost, where larger is better.
- The backend label is 投入产出比, but the formula behaves like a cost ratio.

---

## 7. Refund and Order-Quality Metrics / 退款与订单质量指标

### `refund_amount` / 退款金额

中文定义：所选时间周期内，该账号所选择条件下门店申请退款成功的实际退款到账金额，包含部分退款，不含保险费和重复支付。日期为退款成功日期。

English definition: Actual refund amount successfully returned for the selected account, store, conditions, and time period. It includes partial refunds and excludes insurance fees and duplicate payments. The date is based on refund-success date.

Interpretation: This should be interpreted as refund pressure during the selected period, not as a perfect refund rate for the original order cohort.

### `full_refund_orders` / 退款订单量（全部退款）

中文定义：所选时间周期内，该账号所选择条件下门店退款成功的订单量，不含部分退款。日期为退款成功的日期。

English definition: Number of successfully refunded orders under the selected account, store, conditions, and time period, excluding partial refunds. The date is based on refund-success date.

Interpretation: This is a full-refund order-count metric for the selected refund-success period.

### `refund_orders_all_or_partial` / 退款订单量（全部退款+部分退款）

中文定义：所选时间周期内，该账号所选择条件下门店申请退款成功的订单量，包括全部退和部分退款订单。日期为退款成功日期。

English definition: Number of successfully refunded orders under the selected account, store, conditions, and time period, including both full refunds and partial refunds. The date is based on refund-success date.

Interpretation: This is a full-or-partial refund order-count metric for the selected refund-success period.

### `valid_orders` / 有效订单数

中文定义：商家已接单后，且未被取消的订单数。

English definition: Number of orders accepted by the merchant and not cancelled.

Interpretation: This is an order-status metric. It is not used as the numerator of `order_conversion_rate_pct`.

### `invalid_orders` / 无效订单数

中文定义：已取消的订单数。

English definition: Number of cancelled orders.

## 8. SKU Evidence Metrics / SKU 证据指标

### `sku_rank` / SKU 排名

中文定义：当前 top SKU 证据表中，该 SKU 在所选门店、所选周期内的排名。

English definition: Rank of the SKU within the current top-SKU evidence table for the selected store and period.

### `sku_name` / SKU 名称

中文定义：后台或人工整理的商品 / SKU 名称。

English definition: Product or SKU name recorded from backend evidence or manually structured evidence.

### `sku_transaction_amount` / SKU 成交金额

中文定义：所选门店、所选周期内，该 SKU 对应的成交金额。

English definition: Transaction amount attributed to the listed SKU within the selected store and period.

Important grain rule: This is SKU-level evidence only. It must not be confused with store-level `transaction_amount`.

### `sales_volume` / SKU 销量

中文定义：所选门店、所选周期内，该 SKU 的销量；如后台未展示，则可以为空。

English definition: Sales volume of the listed SKU where available.

### `sku_category_note` / SKU 品类备注

中文定义：当前 demo 中用于辅助解释的轻量品类备注，不代表完整自动 SKU 分类。

English definition: Lightweight category note used for demo interpretation; not full automated SKU classification.

### `top3_sku_transaction_amount` / Top 3 SKU 成交金额

中文定义：当前 demo 中 Top 3 SKU 的成交金额合计。

English definition: Total transaction amount of the top 3 SKUs used in the current demo.

Interpretation: This is lightweight product-mix evidence only. It is not full category-level sales-share analysis.

### `top3_sku_transaction_amount_share_pct` / Top 3 SKU 成交金额占比

中文公式：Top 3 SKU 成交金额占比 = Top 3 SKU 成交金额 / 成交金额

English formula: `top3_sku_transaction_amount_share_pct = top3_sku_transaction_amount / transaction_amount * 100`

Interpretation: This is used only as lightweight qualitative evidence of leading SKU mix.

## 9. Derived Diagnostic Metrics / SQL 派生诊断指标

These fields are not direct Meituan backend labels. They are SQL-derived diagnostic fields calculated from backend-reported metrics.

### `search_exposure_share_pct` / 搜索曝光占比

Formula: `search_exposure_share_pct = search_exposure_users / exposure_users * 100`

Interpretation: Directional measure of how much total store exposure came from search exposure.

### `search_entry_share_pct` / 搜索入店占比

Formula: `search_entry_share_pct = search_entry_users / entry_users * 100`

Interpretation: Directional measure of how much total store entry came from search entry.

Important limitation: This is not perfect user-level attribution because traffic-source users may overlap.

### `search_entry_rate_pct` / 搜索曝光到入店转化率

Formula: `search_entry_rate_pct = search_entry_users / search_exposure_users * 100`

Interpretation: Directional source-level conversion from search exposure to search entry.

### `estimated_income_proxy_ratio_pct` / 预计收入 proxy 占成交金额比例

Formula: `estimated_income_proxy_ratio_pct = estimated_income_proxy / transaction_amount * 100`

Interpretation: This is a platform-displayed income proxy ratio, not audited profit margin.

### `refund_pressure_pct` / 退款压力

Formula: `refund_pressure_pct = refund_amount / transaction_amount * 100`

Interpretation: This is a refund-pressure indicator for the selected period, not an exact cohort refund rate.

### `refund_order_pressure_pct` / 退款订单压力

Formula: `refund_order_pressure_pct = refund_orders_all_or_partial / transaction_orders * 100`

Interpretation: This is an order-count-based refund-pressure indicator.

### `invalid_order_pressure_pct` / 无效订单压力

Formula: `invalid_order_pressure_pct = invalid_orders / (valid_orders + invalid_orders) * 100`

Interpretation: This measures the share of invalid/cancelled orders among valid plus invalid orders.

### `activity_order_share_pct` / 活动订单占比

Formula: `activity_order_share_pct = activity_orders / transaction_orders * 100`

Interpretation: In the current demo, this is used to detect activity-lever profile.

### `merchant_subsidy_share_of_activity_cost_pct` / 商家补贴占活动成本比例

Formula: `merchant_subsidy_share_of_activity_cost_pct = merchant_subsidy_amount / activity_cost * 100`

Interpretation: This measures how much of total activity cost was borne by the merchant.

## 10. Traffic-Source Overlap Rule / 流量来源重叠规则

中文规则：不同来源顾客数量之和有可能会大于门店总曝光人数，因为同一个顾客可以通过多个曝光来源看到门店。

English rule: The sum of customer counts from different traffic sources may exceed total store exposure users because the same customer can see the store through multiple exposure sources.

Therefore:

- source-level exposure users should not be summed as total exposure users;
- source-level entry users should be treated as directional traffic-source signals;
- `search_entry_users / entry_users` is used as a search-entry share signal, not as perfect user-level attribution.

因此：

- 不同来源的曝光人数不能简单相加成总曝光人数；
- 来源级入店人数应作为方向性的流量来源信号；
- `search_entry_users / entry_users` 只作为搜索入店占比信号，不代表完美的用户级归因。

## 11. Metric Consistency Rules / 指标一致性规则

### Rule 1: Do not recompute order conversion from valid orders.

规则 1：不要用有效订单数反推下单转化率。

`order_conversion_rate_pct` follows:

`order_conversion_rate_pct = order_users / entry_users * 100`

It should not be recomputed as:

`valid_orders / entry_users`

because:

- `order_users` / 下单人数 is a user-count funnel metric;
- `valid_orders` / 有效订单数 is an order-status metric;
- `entry_users` / 入店人数 is a user-count traffic metric;
- the backend may use its own UV deduplication and reporting-window logic.

### Rule 2: Do not sum traffic-source users into total exposure users.

规则 2：不要把不同流量来源用户数直接相加成总曝光人数。

Traffic-source user counts may overlap.

不同流量来源用户可能重叠。

### Rule 3: Treat activity and subsidy as operating-lever evidence, not causal proof.

规则 3：将活动与补贴视为经营工具证据，而不是因果证明。

High activity-order share or a low activity cost ratio does not prove that activity caused growth.

高活动订单占比或较低活动成本率，不证明增长一定由活动导致。活动、补贴、价格、SKU 结构、排名和履约信号应结合门店阶段与竞争环境一起解释。

### Rule 4: Treat refund amount as refund pressure, not exact cohort refund rate.

规则 4：将退款金额解释为退款压力，而不是原订单 cohort 的精确退款率。

Refund amount is counted by refund-success date.

退款金额按退款成功日期统计。

### Rule 5: Use backend-reported metrics as source of truth when scope is unclear.

规则 5：当口径不完全明确时，以后台展示指标作为事实来源。

Manual recomputation is only valid when numerator, denominator, time window, deduplication rule, and order-status scope are explicitly aligned.

只有在分子、分母、时间窗口、去重规则、订单状态口径全部明确一致时，才进行手动重算。

### Rule 6: Do not reuse store-level field names for SKU-level evidence.

规则 6：不要把门店级字段名复用到 SKU 粒度。

`transaction_amount` is store-period-level transaction amount.

`sku_transaction_amount` is SKU-period-level transaction amount.

## 12. Field Consistency Checklist

Before adding new SQL outputs, memory facts, or evaluation cases:

- Use the same field names as `store_a_monthly_metrics.csv` for store-period backend metrics.
- Use the same field names as `store_a_top_skus.csv` for SKU-period evidence.
- Do not introduce alternative English names for existing Meituan backend metrics.
- If a new derived metric is added, define its numerator, denominator, time window, and interpretation limit.
- If a field is renamed, update CSV, SQL, SQL output, memory facts, lineage, README, admissions documents, and evaluation cases in the same commit.

## Demo 2 Additional Source Tables

Demo 2 adds cross-store March 2026 source tables. These tables are source-data tables, not memory slots and not store-stage labels.

### demo2_store_period_metrics.csv

This table follows the existing Store A source metric naming pattern wherever possible.

Key naming choices:

- exposure_users, not store_exposure_users
- exposure_times, not store_exposure_times
- entry_times, not entry_visits
- order_times, not order_submissions
- refund_orders_all_or_partial, not full_or_partial_refund_orders
- business_district_rank, not business_area_rank

business_district_rank is included as a supplementary backend-reported field. It should not be used alone as a hard comparability condition because business-district boundaries and local competitive contexts may differ across stores.

### demo2_top_search_terms.csv

This table records the top 3 backend-reported search terms for each store-period.

Fields:

- search_term_rank: rank of the search term in the backend top-search-term list.
- search_term: original backend search term.
- search_term_en: conservative English translation for readability.
- search_term_exposure_times: exposure count for the search term.
- search_term_click_times: click count for the search term.
- search_term_order_times: order count attributed to the search term.

The Chinese search_term remains the source value. search_term_en is only a helper field and should not replace the original backend value.

### demo2_top_skus_by_sales_volume.csv

This table records the top 3 SKUs by backend-reported sales volume for each store-period.

Fields:

- sku_rank
- sku_name
- sku_name_en
- sku_transaction_amount
- sales_volume
- sku_category_note

When transaction amount is not available for a sales-volume-ranked SKU, sku_transaction_amount is left blank.

### demo2_top_skus_by_transaction_amount.csv

This table records the top 3 SKUs by backend-reported SKU transaction amount for each store-period.

Fields:

- sku_rank
- sku_name
- sku_name_en
- sku_transaction_amount
- sales_volume
- sku_category_note

When sales volume is not available for a transaction-amount-ranked SKU, sales_volume is left blank.

### English helper fields

sku_name and search_term preserve the original Chinese backend values.

sku_name_en and search_term_en are conservative English helper translations for readability. They are not treated as source-of-truth backend values.

### SKU category handling

Demo 2 does not perform full manual SKU category classification.

For Demo 2 source tables, sku_category_note = not_classified means the SKU name is retained as source evidence but not converted into a full product-category taxonomy.

### Current Boundary Wording for Validators

These exact boundary phrases are intentionally preserved for consistency checks:

- `region_type remains weak context only`
- `activity_cost_ratio_pct` is not traditional ROI.
- `top3_sku_transaction_amount_share_pct` is not full product-category share.
