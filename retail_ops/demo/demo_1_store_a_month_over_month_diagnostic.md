# Demo 1: Store A Month-over-Month Retail Operations Diagnostic

## Purpose

This demo uses one real Meituan-style retail store as a narrow diagnostic example.

The goal is not to prove that one factor caused growth or decline. The goal is to show how messy merchant-backend metrics can be organized into a consistent, traceable decision-support prototype.

The current demo covers Store A from February 2026 to April 2026.

The month labels use natural calendar-month windows: `2026-02` means `2026-02-01` to `2026-02-28`, `2026-03` means `2026-03-01` to `2026-03-31`, and `2026-04` means `2026-04-01` to `2026-04-30`.

## Business Context

In this project, Meituan instant-retail stores are understood through a chain of operating conditions:

```text
being seen -> being entered -> being ordered -> being selected again or maintaining market share
```

A store may use activity subsidy, pricing, ranking optimization, SKU mix, and fulfillment control as operating levers inside this chain.

These levers should not be interpreted as isolated causes. Their meaning depends on the store's current stage, local competition, visibility pressure, conversion quality, order quality, and product mix.

Short-term ROI is not always the primary target. A new store may need activity subsidy to gain exposure and first orders. A store under external price pressure may need activity or pricing action to defend visibility and market share. A store with enough traffic but weak conversion requires a different interpretation from a store with order growth but refund pressure.

## Current Demo Boundary

This is a single-store month-over-month diagnostic.

It does not implement:

- cross-store comparison;
- store-stage diagnosis;
- causal attribution;
- margin-aware recommendation;
- full SKU category-share analysis;
- automated ingestion from the Meituan backend.

The current demo only supports cautious interpretation of Store A's observed metrics.

## Metric Definition Rules

This demo follows the project data dictionary.

Important consistency rules:

1. `order_conversion_rate_pct` follows the backend funnel definition:

   ```text
   order_conversion_rate_pct = order_users / entry_users * 100
   ```

   It should not be recalculated as:

   ```text
   valid_orders / entry_users
   ```

2. `activity_cost_ratio_pct` follows the backend-style formula:

   ```text
   activity_cost_ratio_pct = activity_cost / activity_original_transaction_amount * 100
   ```

   This is a cost ratio. It should not be treated as traditional ROI.

3. Traffic-source users may overlap. Source-level users should not be summed into total exposure users or total entry users.

4. Top-SKU evidence is only lightweight product-mix evidence. It is not full category-level sales-share analysis.

## Store A Monthly Snapshot

| Month | Transaction Amount | Transaction Orders | Entry Users | Order Conversion Rate | Average Order Value | Refund Amount |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 2026-02 | 9460.70 | 274 | 763 | 37.22% | 34.53 | 1480.95 |
| 2026-03 | 6454.84 | 207 | 522 | 42.34% | 31.18 | 1097.97 |
| 2026-04 | 9083.72 | 337 | 906 | 37.42% | 26.95 | 602.26 |

## Visibility and Entry Profile

Store A's visibility and entry structure can be described from exposure, ranking, entry, and search-entry metrics.

| Month | Exposure Users | Store Average Rank | Entry Users | Search Entry Users | Search Entry Share |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 2026-02 | 6118 | 18 | 763 | 694 | 90.96% |
| 2026-03 | 4663 | 22 | 522 | 445 | 85.25% |
| 2026-04 | 8366 | 18 | 906 | 839 | 92.60% |

Interpretation:

- March had weaker exposure, weaker average rank, fewer entry users, and fewer search-entry users.
- April recovered in exposure, rank, entry users, and search-entry users.
- These metrics describe whether the store was being seen and entered.
- They do not prove that visibility alone caused transaction recovery.

## Activity-Lever Profile

Activity metrics are interpreted as operating-lever evidence.

| Month | Activity Orders | Transaction Orders | Activity Order Share | Activity Cost Ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 2026-02 | 270 | 274 | 98.54% | 40.63% |
| 2026-03 | 201 | 207 | 97.10% | 38.55% |
| 2026-04 | 329 | 337 | 97.63% | 40.69% |

Interpretation:

- Activity orders accounted for a high share of transaction orders in all three months.
- This does not mean activity alone caused growth.
- It means activity was an important operating lever during the observed period.
- The meaning of this lever depends on store stage, competition, price pressure, ranking pressure, and order-quality signals.

## Transaction and Conversion Profile

April recovered in transaction scale compared with March.

| Metric | 2026-03 | 2026-04 | Direction |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Transaction Amount | 6454.84 | 9083.72 | Up |
| Transaction Orders | 207 | 337 | Up |
| Entry Users | 522 | 906 | Up |
| Search Entry Users | 445 | 839 | Up |
| Order Conversion Rate | 42.34% | 37.42% | Down |
| Average Order Value | 31.18 | 26.95 | Down |

Interpretation:

April's recovery should not be read as a simple quality improvement.

The store had more exposure, more entry users, more transaction orders, and higher transaction amount, but order conversion rate and average order value declined.

This supports a cautious operating-signal reading: the store recovered scale, but the recovery coexisted with weaker conversion rate and lower average order value.

## Order-Quality Pressure Profile

Refund and invalid-order pressure improved in April compared with March.

| Metric | 2026-03 | 2026-04 | Direction |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Refund Amount | 1097.97 | 602.26 | Down |
| Refund Pressure | 17.01% | 6.63% | Down |
| Invalid Orders | 32 | 29 | Down |
| Invalid-Order Pressure | 13.62% | 7.99% | Down |

Interpretation:

This is an order-quality pressure signal.

It does not prove that customer satisfaction definitively improved, because refund amount is counted by refund-success date and is not a perfect original-order cohort refund rate.

## Top-SKU Evidence

The top-SKU evidence is mainly care-solution-heavy.

This evidence is useful as a lightweight product-mix signal, but it is not full category-level sales-share analysis.

The current demo does not manually classify all SKUs, and it does not claim full SKU-category coverage.

## Single-Metric Attribution Guard

The main lesson of this demo is that Store A's monthly changes should not be explained by one metric alone.

April 2026 showed:

- transaction amount up;
- transaction orders up;
- exposure users up;
- entry users up;
- search-entry users up;
- order conversion rate down;
- average order value down;
- refund pressure down;
- invalid-order pressure down;
- activity-order share still high;
- top-SKU evidence still limited.

This is exactly why the project uses a memory layer with traceable facts and limitations. The system should remember observed signals, source fields, and caveats instead of producing a one-factor explanation.

## Current Retail Memory Slots

The current generated retail memory facts use these slots:

| Slot | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `visibility_entry_profile` | Describes exposure, ranking, entry, and search-entry structure. |
| `activity_lever_profile` | Describes activity orders, activity cost, subsidy, and activity-cost ratio as operating-lever evidence. |
| `transaction_conversion_profile` | Describes transaction scale, order conversion, payment, and average order value. |
| `order_quality_pressure_profile` | Describes refund pressure and invalid-order pressure. |
| `single_metric_attribution_guard` | Prevents one-factor explanations of growth or decline. |
| `top3_sku_product_mix_note` | Limits top-SKU evidence to lightweight product-mix support. |

## What This Demo Supports

This demo supports:

- consistent field naming;
- SQL-derived diagnostic metrics;
- cautious month-over-month comparison;
- traceable retail memory facts;
- refusal of unsupported cross-store claims;
- refusal of unsupported causal attribution.

## What This Demo Does Not Support

This demo does not support:

- deciding which of 48 stores should receive more subsidy;
- claiming that a strategy from Store A transfers to another store;
- judging another store's operating stage;
- proving that activity caused growth;
- claiming that visibility alone explains growth;
- proving full SKU-category sales structure;
- calculating actual profit or margin.

## Future Work

Demo 1 has already led into the current Demo 2 comparability path. The next step is to make comparability rules more testable and expand the same field contract to more store-period records.

Future expansion should check whether stores can be compared by:

- aligned reporting period;
- coarse market context;
- store type;
- order volume band;
- visibility and ranking profile;
- entry and order-conversion profile;
- activity-order share and subsidy profile;
- refund and invalid-order pressure;
- dominant top-SKU evidence;
- data completeness.

Only after this comparability check should the system attempt cross-store interpretation. Store-stage diagnosis should remain out of scope until the project has stronger evidence on promotion cycles, competition, fulfillment conditions, rating/review signals, and stockout history.
